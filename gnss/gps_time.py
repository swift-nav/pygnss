def gps_format_to_datetime(wn, tow):
    """
    Converts a time using week number and time of week representation
    into a python datetime object.  Note that this does NOT convert
    into UTC.  The resulting datetime object is still in GPS time
    and will have been rounded to nanosecond precision (which is
    too coarse to accurately compute timedeltas such as time of
    flight.

    Parameters
    -----------
    wn : int
      An integer corresponding to the week number of a time.
    tow : float
      A float corresponding to the time of week (in seconds) from
      the beginning of the week number (wn).

    Returns
    -------
    utc : np.datetime64
      Returns a np.datetime64 object (or an array of them) that holds
      the UTC representation of the corresponding gpst.

    leap seconds).

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : np.datetime64, pd.Timestamp, datetime.datetime
      A datetime object (possibly an array) that is convertable to

    UTC leap second is added between 23:59:59 and 00:00:00 in UTC time.
    This function's input is gps time so the time offset changes e.g.
    between 00:00:16 and 00:00:17 in GPS time.

    Convert a GPS time either in datetime or week number, time of week
    format into UTC.
    Use leap second correction from hard-coded look-up table.

    Note that the output is incorrect during the leap second because of
    Python datetime64 bug (see http://bugs.python.org/issue23574)
